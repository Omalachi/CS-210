Project 3: Corner Grocer â€“ Reflection
Project Summary

Project 3, Corner Grocer, is an item-tracking program developed using C++ and Python. The project was designed to analyze daily purchases and meet three key requirements:

    Generate a list of all purchased items along with their purchase frequency.
    Allow users to query how many times a specific item was bought in a day.
    Display a text-based histogram visually representing item purchase counts.

The program utilized starter code that linked C++ and Python, processing input from a text-based file to generate the necessary reports.
Strengths in My Implementation

One of the strongest aspects of my implementation was its structured and modular design. I ensured that functions were used effectively to break down tasks, making the program more readable and maintainable. This approach helped keep the main() function clean and concise while ensuring that each function handled a specific responsibility.
Areas for Improvement

With more time and practice, I would enhance the project by:

    Incorporating object-oriented programming (OOP): Using classes would make the program more modular, reducing redundancy and making it easier to modify.
    Improving function design: Refining function structures would enhance efficiency and make the code more scalable for larger datasets.

These improvements would increase code maintainability and adaptability, ensuring it remains efficient for future enhancements.
Challenges Faced & Solutions

One of the most challenging aspects was working with pointers in C++. Although I opted not to use them in this project due to their complexity, I recognize their importance in memory management and performance optimization. To overcome this, I plan to further study pointers and incorporate them into future projects. C++ provides extensive documentation, and leveraging resources like tutorials and practice problems will help strengthen my understanding.
Transferable Skills

This project reinforced several valuable skills, particularly:

    Multi-language integration: Learning to connect C++ and Python efficiently is a crucial skill in software development. Many modern applications require multiple languages working together, making this experience highly relevant.
    File handling in Python: The ability to read, process, and manipulate files is essential for data-driven applications, automation, and software development.

These skills will be directly applicable to future coursework and real-world projects, especially in full-stack development and data processing.
Code Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability

To ensure that my code remains maintainable and adaptable, I:

    Used well-structured functions in both C++ and Python, making the program easier to read and modify.
    Added clear, concise comments throughout the code, providing essential details for future updates.
    Ensured proper formatting and documentation, following industry best practices to make the code more professional and easier to understand.

By applying these principles, the project remains scalable, efficient, and easy to extend, ensuring that future modifications can be made with minimal effort.
